<h2>Electronic Output Devices</h2>

<p>This week our assignment was to make something using a mould and using CNC</p>

<p>Credit: Mustafa Omran, Jonathan Teng</p>

<p>As for the molding and casting, we took permission from the professor and worked on a group project together to make the head of a rubber chicken that we found in the lab</p>

<p>We ran into a few problems at first, our first problem was that the head of the chicken was empty and therefore if we tried to mold it, it would have gotten stuck</p>

<p>We solved this problem by filling the chicken with silicone, we then used this filled-in chicken head to make the mold</p>

<p>we then filled in this mold with metal to make ourselves a metal chicken head</p>

<p>As for the CNC, I tried to remodel one of my favourite characters katanas and it turned out mostly well</p>

<p>I had quite a few issues with the shop bot machine as the spindle snapped and my design also wasnt being oriented properly</p>

<p>to fix this problem, Suvin helped me replace the spindle and I also oriented the wooden board vertically to fix the vertical problem</p>

<p>Although I measured the thickness accurately, it didn't cut all the way through and I am currently trying to cut my katana out</p>
