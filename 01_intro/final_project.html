      <h1>The Final Project</h1>

      <h2>The First Idea:</h2>
    
      <img src ="./IMG_0966.png" class="center">
      <img src ="./IMG_0967.png" class="center">
    
      <p>My plan for the final project is two machines put together. The first one is a device that alt+tabs on my computer when my room door opens. I have 3 options designed as showcased above</p>

      <p>My first machine will work using a Hall Sensor and an ESP32, I will use the Hall sensor to send an inout to my computer about the door's position and then using that input, I can use the alt+tab function on my computer.</p>
    
      <p>My second machine is a door closes that works on input from my computer</p>

      <p>The main part of this door closer is the linear actuator. The calculations and measurements and listed below</p>

      <p>The linear actuator design I looked at is 12"(11.9) inches long and can extend to 4 inches using 12V and 150lb of force</p>

      <img src ="./IMG_0969.png" class="center">

      <p>This linear actuator can push the door to 50* and momentum should take care of the rest according to my calculations</p>

      <p>This video documents the basis of a linear actuator which is the main part I will use to create my door closer<a href="url">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9V2GY1WaRU</a></p>

      <h3><b>The Final Idea</b></h3>

      <p>After a lot of problems with my first idea, my second and final idea was something similar but better, this project is an alarm system with a keycard</p>

      <p>The alarm system is a silent one along with a hidden camera to get footage and upload it so that the police can find this said burglar</p>

      <p>My inspiration for this project happened during summer school when I left my computer open and went to drink water, and when I returned, someone had tampered with it and therefore, I wish to create more security</p>

      <p>This final project has 3 major modules, a camera as mentioned before, a sensor to detect when someone opens or closes a door, and a card reader so that I do not trigger the alarm every time I wake into the room myself</p>
      
      <p>The first module I would like to talk about is the sensor, it works using a magnet and a hall effect sensor</p>

      

      <p><b>What is a Hall Effect Sensor?</b></p>

      <center><img src ="./halleffectimg.png" class="center"></center>

      <p>To put it simply, a Hall effect sensor is one which detects a change in a magnetic field and sends an electronic signal on detection of this change</p>
      <p>I can trigger this sensor by simply attaching a magnet to the door which opens and just simply calibrating the sensor so that it can detect when the door opens and closes</p>
      <p>To test it out, I initially coded it to say "Intruder Alert" wheneever it detects a change, and later, I coded it to change a variable on open and closure of the door so that it can keep track and then send said alarm</p>
      <p>The circuit for the diagram is below</p>

      <p>This is a video of the sensor giving me the "intruder alert" on detection of change in the magnetic field</p>

      <p><b>What is an RFID scanner</b></p>

      <p>RFID stands for Radio Frequency Identity, It uses electromagnetic fields to transfer data over short distances. It is useful to identify people, to make transactions, etc.</p>
      <p>You can use an RFID system to open a door. For example, only the person with the right information on his card is allowed to enter. An RFID system uses:<p></p>

      <p>tags attached to the object to be identified, in this example we have a keychain and an electromagnetic card. Each tag has his own identification (UID)  tags</p>

      <p>two-way radio transmitter-receiver, the reader, that send a signal to the tag and read its response</p>

      <p>I used the code provided by randomnerdtutorials and then modified it to my liking to use in my final project</p>

      <p>The video below shows testing of the RFID scanner</p>

      <p><b>ESP-32 CAM</b></p>

      <p>Since people generally know what a camera is, I'm not going to go through the basics of a camera, but the point of using an ESP-32 camera is that an ESP-32 is a wifi enabled board that can stream data onto a site over a wireless connection therefore making it a lot easier to use</p>
      <p>The ESP-32 comes in quite handy for me as I can access this over a live server and I can make a website to control this quite easily</p>
      <p>To use the ESP-32 CAM, use this randomnerdtutorials link as it was extremely handy for me when wiring the ESP32-CAM</p>
