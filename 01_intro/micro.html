<p>For the Microcontroller programming I built a launchpad for my helicopter that can loop</p>

<p>I initially made the code using the delay() function but I found the code weird so I updated this code with code from the next class because it was more efficient and functional. It uses the millis() function instead of the delay() function and it is a series of 3 LEDs that are all of different color and each of them go in order</p>

<p>I tried to do something cool with the code by incrementing and decrementing the currentMillis variable so that i could add a delay in between the pulse of each light bulb and my logic worked out so I stuck it in the program instead of the normal modification of the onTime and the offTime</p>

<p>I use 3 resistors and 3 LEDs for this so that the LEDs do not get harmed from a voltage surge. I placed all the LEDs in a line so that it looked like an actual launchpad, the colors I wanted were not there but I did it regardless. My aim with assembling this breadboard was to make it look as simple as functional as possible as I don't like it when the code and the wiring is messy and it is a pet peeve of mine</p>

<p>It took me a while to code and get together all the parts but I succeeded at the end. </p>
