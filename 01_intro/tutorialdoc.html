<p>I did the first fusion 360 tutorial provided on the website, it took me a while to figure it out but I think I can say that I've got the hang of it</p>

<p>The first shape was the most annoying as I was trying to get all the dimensions perfectly right but it taught me the importance of the create dimensionm tool</p>

<p>In the second one, I found the tangent tool pretty weird to use. Although this isnt exactly like the one in the tutorial, it makes use of all the same features</p>

<p>The third one was the easiest as I had already gotten the hang of it from the earlier figures</p>
