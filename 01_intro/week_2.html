Week 2:
In this class our project was to make a press-cut model and here is the documentation of mine

I initially started out making a somewhat chain-like model, but I gave up on that idea as I didnt think it would be structurally sound nor would it fit the specifications of the assignment

Now with a bit of knowledge of fusion 360 I started a more ambitious project.
I tried to create Loki's sceptre from marvel with a few simple press-cut shapes.

I tried to design this but it was hard to do using only simple shapes.

My final product was a simple 'modern art piece'(in my opinion) containing squares with 8 slits so that it could be attached diagonally, horizontally and vertically.

At first I had made my slits too small.

The second time they were too large due to incorrect kerf measurements.

The third and final time I nailed it and created a structurally sound shape.
