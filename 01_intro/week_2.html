<p>In this class our project was to make a press-fit model and here is the documentation of mine</p>

<p>I initially started out making a somewhat chain-like model, but I gave up on that idea as I didnt think it would be structurally sound nor would it fit the specifications of the assignment</p>

<p>Now with a bit of knowledge of fusion 360 I started a more ambitious project.</p>

<p>I tried to create Loki's sceptre from marvel with a few simple press-cut shapes.</p>

<p>I tried to design this but it was hard to do using only simple shapes.</p>

<p>My final product was a simple 'modern art piece'(in my opinion) containing squares with 8 slits so that it could be attached diagonally, horizontally and vertically.</p>

<p>At first I had made my slits too small.</p>

<p>The second time they were too large due to incorrect kerf measurements.</p>

<p>The third and final time I nailed it and created a structurally sound shape.</p>
