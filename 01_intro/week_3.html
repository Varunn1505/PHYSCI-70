<p>For the next project I decided to build a helicopter after a lot of idea changes and a lot of bothering suvin</p>

<p>I built the helicopter in a rush but I'm quite proud of it</p>

<p>I initially cut it out of a wooden slab but then it just looked like a deformed oval</p>

<p>I later decided to 2D print the helicopter as I thought it would look much better and I am a lot happier than the deformed ellipse</p>

<p>For the main propeller, I decided to make it myself and cut it out of wood as i felt that 2D printing everything would be far too easy</p>

<p>The helicopter finally worked so now I had to move on to arduino</p>

<p>I initially had a lot of problems with the arduino as the port was not working with my laptop but Professor Melenbrink fixed it and now I was ready to build my arduino circuit</p>

<p>I had big ideas on how to implement the arduino and breadboard into my helicopter but most of that ended up not working</p>

<p>After a lot of work, I created a start/stop button for my helicopter which just turns off and turns on the helicopter with each press of the button</p>
