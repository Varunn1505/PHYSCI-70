<h2>Electronic Output Devices</h2>

<p>This week, I teamed up with Jonathan to make a temperature regulator</p>
<p>My first idea, which did not work out so well was to make a controller that could control my computer</p>

<p>To start out, I decided to use the example provided on arduino and Professor Melenbrink's website to turn on and off an LED and that went smoothly without any errors</p>

<p>After that, I spent a long time trying to reuse similar code to control a motor and that did not end up too well</p>

<p>After I had a bit of experience with ESP32, I was ready to work on the project with Jonathan, we used a thermistor that he had built earlier to input live temperatures, but we ran into a problem with this</p>

<p>It turns out that the ESP only has a select number of analog pins which we could connect the thermistor to, and it took a long time to figure this out</p>

<p>Now that we had connected it to the analog pin, it still did not work properly as the reading came out really weird, to solve this we spent a while calibrating the thermistor so that we could accurately use it to capture the temperature in degrees celsius</p>

<p>Now that we had a chunk of work done, we used the wiring and code from the LED I had used before so that it could light up on reaching the right temperature</p>

<p>All that was left was to get the input from the user so that we could regulate to the right temperature</p>

<p>For this, we followed a random nerd tutorial to get the input and the code is below</p>

<p>Although this machine still does not regulate properly it's a lot of progress</p>
